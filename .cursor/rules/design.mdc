# Design Rules

## Expo UI

When using some Expo UI components, always remember to wrap them into a `Host` from `@expo/ui/swift-ui`

## Liquid Glass

When the user ask to implement something using Liquid Glass, first try to use the @callstack/liquid-glass library. The documentation for the library can be found here: node_modules/@callstack/liquid-glass/README.md

If the user is not happy with the result, you can try and use Expo UI instead. The documentation can befound here: node_modules/@expo/ui

## Context Menu

Always use Expo UI to implement context menus. 

Never use react-native-ios-context-menu library.

## Dependencies

If you have to add a dependency, always reinstall dependencies using the command: `npx expo prebuild --clean`
