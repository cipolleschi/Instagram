# Design Rules

## Liquid Glass

When the user ask to implement something using Liquid Glass, first try to use the @callstack/liquid-glass library. The documentation for the library can be found here: node_modules/@callstack/liquid-glass/README.md

If the user is not happy with the result, you can try and use Expo UI instead. The documentation can befound here: node_modules/@expo/ui
